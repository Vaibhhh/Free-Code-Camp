# Monk-and-the-Island
Monk visits the land of Islands. There are a total of N islands numbered from 1 to N. Some pairs of islands are connected to each other by Bidirectional bridges running over water. Monk hates to cross these bridges as they require a lot of efforts. He is standing at Island #1 and wants to reach the Island #N. Find the minimum the number of bridges that he shall have to cross, if he takes the optimal route.  Input: First line contains T. T testcases follow. First line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N, M. Each of the next M lines contains two space-separated integers X and Y , denoting that there is a bridge between Island X and Island Y.  Output: Print the answer to each test case in a new line.
